Aloha! I’m an experienced professional with over 13 years of service at the **State of Hawaii - Medquest Division**, where I specialized in Medicaid eligibility, policy interpretation, and public service. My career has been defined by my attention to detail, ability to simplify complex processes, and dedication to helping others. Now, I’m transitioning into the tech world, where I am excited to apply my problem-solving skills and passion for technology.

I'm currently enrolled in the **Software QA Engineering** program at **Careerist**, where I am gaining hands-on experience in quality assurance and software development. My goal is to contribute to the tech industry while continuing to help others through innovation, education, and service.
